	<h2>Designer</h2>
	<p>I have always loved the fine arts. After completing an apprenticeship to an art studio, I decided to focus on my art skills practical areas for the tech industry. With that in mind, I worked in projects involving animation and UX design. Here are some highlights. </p>

					<h1>Webdesign and Social Media Campaign for WRC</h1>
					<p>Georgia Tech's Women's Resource Center lacked campus awareness. To change that, I was tasked with revamping the department's website and developing a new social media plan. With the suggested changes, the website traffic increased by 200% in one month.</p>

					<h1>UI Design for SCBA Monitoring</h1>
					<p>Oxygen tanks used by firefighters lack good methods to monitor the remaining air time. For a device that can be attached to an SCBA system to monitor the oxygen levels, I designed an app capable of relaying the information to the commander.</p>
