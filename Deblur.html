	<h2>Deblurring for Biorobotics Lab</h2>
	
	<p>The Biorobotics and Human Modelling Lab at Georgia Tech creates robots based on the physiology of animals. One of their long standing projects is a NSF-funded research on simulating the rapid-eye movement of humans to reduce camera blur at high speeds. I was tasked with investigating a linear camera trajectory capable of minimizing blur and allowing for a higher quality image reconstruction, with the final objective of increasing OCR accuracy on texts shot at such speeds.</p>
	
	<p>I started by studying different image reconstruction algorithms and understanding the process used to see how the blur affects the process. Since these kinds of algorithms take a blur kernel, or an estimation of the trajectory, controlling such trajectory leads to exact (and not estimated) kernels, which can be used to increase the accuracy of the reconstruction. I then analysed the blur generated by different trajectories, and noticed that the inverse error function generates a gaussian blur, which is especially suited for deblurring.</p>
	
	
	
	<p>To test that theory, I built a linear stage and installed a camera in it. By controlling the speed of the motor, I shot images with different trajectories and then deblurred them. Starting with qualitative tests, I shot images of stationary objects, which indicated a higher sharpness when shot using the inverse error trajectory. The quantitative tests were done using signs and the OneNote OCR machine. The accuracy of the OCR reading was used to indicate the quality of the deblur.

	<p>The results from this research were presented at the 2018 IROS conference, and published <a class="link" href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8594315" target="_blank">published</a> by IEEE.</p>
